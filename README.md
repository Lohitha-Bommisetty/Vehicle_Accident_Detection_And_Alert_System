# 🚗Vehicle_Accident_Detection_And_Alert_System
An IoT-based embedded safety system that automatically detects vehicle accidents using motion sensors and instantly alerts emergency contacts with precise GPS location via GSM communication.
Designed to reduce emergency response time and improve post-accident survival chances.
📌 ##Problem Statement

Road accidents often result in delayed medical assistance, especially in remote or low-visibility areas where victims cannot call for help. Traditional accident reporting relies on human intervention, which may not always be possible during severe crashes.

This project addresses the problem by automatically detecting accidents and triggering emergency alerts without human involvement, ensuring that help reaches victims within the critical golden hour.
